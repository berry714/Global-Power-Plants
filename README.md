Collaborations and reliance on other resources:
What did you learn from a peer map critique, if you did one?
I didn't conduct a peer map critique with anyone from the class but did ask around and user test my map with numerous people. Initial user testing was conducted very early on in the map creation process, before I had styled my data. Therefore, much of the feedback centered around stylistic choices (which I asssumed would occur). More helpful suggestions came from the insight and purpose of my map, which led to a sequence of decisions that ultimately resulted in my final map. These suggestions led directly to the creation of the capacity slider as well as the checkboxes for each fuel type. They helped in deciding to not implement a dropdown menu (which was originially implemented) and instead use checkboxes for ease of control and accessibility. Also, the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions as a layer that could be toggled provides further insight into power plants without taking the focus away from them.

What coding resources (and individuals) did you draw upon in the process of making your map, and to what effect?
I relied heavily on tutorials and examples of varying degrees provided by Mapbox on Mapbox GL JS. In addition to this, issues were troubleshooted with frequent visits to stack overflow and GIS stack exchange in addition to a whole lot of trial and error.
