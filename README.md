Collaborations and reliance on other resources:
What did you learn from a peer map critique, if you did one?
I didn't conduct a peer map critique with anyone from the class but did ask around and user test my map with numerous other people. Initial user testing was conducted very early on in the map creation process, before I had styled my data. Therefore, much of the feedback centered around stylistic choices (which I asssumed would occur). More helpful suggestions came from the insight and purpose of my map, which led to a sequence of decisions that ultimately resulted in my final map. These suggestions led directly to the creation of the capacity slider as well as the checkboxes for each fuel type. They helped in deciding to not implement a dropdown menu (which was originially implemented) and instead use checkboxes for ease of control and accessibility. Also, the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions as a layer that could be toggled provides further insight into power plants without taking the focus away from them.

What coding resources (and individuals) did you draw upon in the process of making your map, and to what effect?
I relied heavily on tutorials and examples of varying degrees provided by Mapbox on Mapbox GL JS. In addition to this, issues were troubleshooted with frequent visits to stack overflow and GIS stack exchange in addition to a whole lot of trial and error.

Reflective Analysis:
The interactive map "Exploring The World's Power Plants" aims to visualize the global distribution of power plants, emphasizing capacity, fuel type, and including a few supplementary pieces of information per country. Targeted towards environmental researchers, policymakers, and educators, and the general public interested in the global energy landscape. This map attempts to foster a comprehensive understanding of the distribution of energy generation facilities and the diversity of fuel types around the world. This project seeks to address questions related to the geographical and operational diversity of power plants worldwide, facilitating a comparative analysis of energy profiles among different countries.

The development of this map followed a structured design process, incorporating iterative phases of design and user feedback, aligned with the principles outlined by Roth (2017) in his article on UI/UX Design within GIS. Initial stages focused on data collection and preparation, and the styling of the power plants layer. Then followed the integration of interactive elements—such as filters for fuel types and sliders for plant capacity—to enable dynamic user exploration of the dataset. Next (inspired by user feedback) incorporating GHG emissions data as a supplementary layer aimed to enrich the analysis by providing context on environmental impacts. The choice of data and the cartographic stylings were intellectually justified by the aim to present complex datasets in an accessible manner, fostering insights into global energy production dynamics. Colors of point symbols, sorted by fuel type and sized based on capacity (MW), provide a simplified and more accessible way to view the data.

However, the map's effectiveness is constrained by the extent of its data granularity and the user interface's intuitiveness. While successful in offering a broad overview, the representation could be improved through higher-resolution data, enabling more detailed regional analyses. Future iterations could benefit from incorporating user feedback mechanisms to refine interactivity and data representation, ensuring the map evolves to meet user needs more effectively. Furthermore, enhancing the visual differentiation between fuel types and expanding the analytical tools to include temporal changes in energy production and GHG emissions would significantly augment the map's utility. The iterative design process, guided by user experience considerations as emphasized by Roth (2017), underscores the importance of continuous improvement and adaptation in developing effective cartographic representations.
